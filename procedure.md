### Procedure
In the following simulation, you will have to select Miller planes given a Miller index. Ideally, a lattice is infinite and has many unit cells but for the sake of simplicity, we have made the lattice finite while still allowing for the user to be able to pick any plane from the family of planes corresponding to one index.

Below are the steps for the experiment
- The interface will contain a canvas in which the different finite lattices in question are shown.
- The interface contains a dropdown to select lattice, a button to select atoms (which is a toggle switch), a button to create plane from the selected atoms, a button to clear your choices and a button to check the choice made.
- In the select mode, left click can be used to select an atom and right click can be used to de-select an atom.
- The plane created by these three atoms needs to be then visualized using the "create plane" option. Once this plane is created, the "check miller index" button evaluates the selection made based on the miller indices selected through the dropdown
