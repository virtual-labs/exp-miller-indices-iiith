### Procedure
In the following simulation, you will have to select Miller planes given a Miller index. Ideally, a lattice is infinite and has many unit cells but for the sake of simplicity, we have made the lattice finite while still allowing for the user to be able to pick any plane from the family of planes corresponding to one index.

Below are the steps for the experiment
- The interface has an option to choose which lattice the experiment is going to be performed on in the form of a dropdown.
- Once the lattice is chosen, there is again an option to choose on which Miller index is the plane going to be constructed for. This too is in the form of a dropdown
- The "select atoms" is a toggle switch. When clicked, it enables for selection of atoms from the lattice. Now the atoms that make the required Miller plane need to be picked.
- The plane created by these three atoms needs to be then visualized using the "create plane" option. Once this plane is created, the "check miller index" button returns the correctness of the selection of plane made for the given lattice and index.
